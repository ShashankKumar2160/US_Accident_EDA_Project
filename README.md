# 🚗 US Accidents EDA Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on road accidents in the United States to uncover patterns, trends, and potential risk factors that contribute to traffic incidents. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to provide insights that could aid in improving road safety.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** US Accidents Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Open Data Portal
- **Records:** Millions of accident reports
- **Features:** Date, Time, Location, Weather, Road Type, Traffic Signals, Severity, etc.

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Understand accident distribution across states and cities  
✅ Analyze time-based trends (seasonality, rush hours, weekends vs. weekdays)  
✅ Assess the impact of weather and road conditions on accident severity  
✅ Perform geospatial analysis to detect accident-prone zones  
✅ Provide data-driven insights for traffic management and safety improvements  

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Time Analysis:** What are the peak accident hours?
- **Location Analysis:** Which states and cities have the highest accident rates?
- **Weather & Road Conditions:** How do environmental factors influence accident severity?
- **Severity Analysis:** Identifying factors that lead to severe accidents
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping high-risk accident zones

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Folium, GeoPandas
- **Machine Learning (Optional):** Scikit-learn for predictive modeling

## 📈 Visualizations
📌 **Heatmaps:** Identifying accident hotspots  
📌 **Time Series Analysis:** Accident trends over time  
📌 **Scatter Plots:** Relationship between weather and severity  
📌 **Choropleth Maps:** Interactive maps highlighting high-risk zones  
📌 **Bar Charts & Histograms:** Breakdown of accidents by severity, location, and time
